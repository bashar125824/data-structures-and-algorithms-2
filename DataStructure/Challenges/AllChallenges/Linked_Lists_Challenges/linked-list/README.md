# Singly Linked List

***A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.***

## Challenge Summary & API


***In this challenge , I should create two classes , Node and linked list , and I should add some methods to linked list class , which are :***

- **insert**
*Arguments: int value*
*Returns: nothing*
*Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.*

- **includes**
*Arguments: int value*
*Returns: Boolean*
*Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.*

- **to string**
*Arguments: none*
*Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List .*

## Approach & Efficiency

***Time Complexity : O(N)***
***Space Complexity : O(1)***

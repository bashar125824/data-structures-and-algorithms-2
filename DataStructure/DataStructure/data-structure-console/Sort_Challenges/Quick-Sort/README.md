# What is Quick-Sort ?

***Quick-Sort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where :***

1. ***An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array).***

2. ***While dividing the array, the pivot element should be positioned in such a way that elements less than pivot are kept on the left side and elements greater than pivot are on the right side of the pivot.***

3. ***The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. This process continues until each subarray contains a single element.***

4. ***At this point, elements are already sorted. Finally, elements are combined to form a sorted array.***

# Quicksort Applications

***Quicksort algorithm is used when :***

- **the programming language is good for recursion**
- **time complexity matters**
- **space complexity matters**

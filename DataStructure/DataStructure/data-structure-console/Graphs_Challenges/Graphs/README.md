# Graphs

***A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.***

## Challenge

***In this challenge , I suppose to implement Graph class that contains some methods , like : add node , add edge , add nodes , get neighbors and size methods***

## Approach & Efficiency

***Space Complexity : I couldn't determine***

***Time Complexity :***

***Add node : O(1)***
***Add edge : O(1)***

## API

***add node**
- *Arguments: value*
- *Returns: The added node*
- *Add a node to the graph*

**add edge**
- *Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)*
- *Returns: nothing*
- *Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph*

**get nodes**
- *Arguments: none*
- *Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)*

**get neighbors**
- *Arguments: node*
- *Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node*
- *Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection*

**size**
- *Arguments: none*
- *Returns the total number of nodes in the graph*

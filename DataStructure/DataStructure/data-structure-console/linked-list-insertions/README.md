# Challenge 

***In this challenge , I should implement 3 methods for linked list insertions , which are , append , insertBefore and insertAfter***

***append(value) method , which take an integer value as an argument , and add a new node with that value , to the end of the linked list.***

***insertBefore(value , newValue) method , which take 2 integer values as arguments , adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified***

***insertAfter(value , newValue) method , which take 2 integer values as arguments , adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified***

***In this code , 4 nodes with their values has been added , 33 , 9 , 78 and 897 using append method , then using insertBefore method a new node with value 8080 has been added before node 33 value , then insertAfter added a new node with value 100 after node 9 value , so the linked list look finally like in terminal IMG .***
